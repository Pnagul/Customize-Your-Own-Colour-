# Customize Your Own Colour: A RBG colour simulator!

## Overview
This is my very first personal project that is outside coursework/university cirruculum! This project showcases a Python desktop application developed with Tkinter, enabling users to create custom RGB color codes through an intuitive and visually appealing GUI. It utilizes object-oriented programming, event-driven techniques, and input validation, ensuring a seamless user experience. 

## How to Run the Program:

- Ensure you have installed the most current version of `Python` & `tkinter` packages.
- Download the `Customize Your Own Colour.py` file
- Run the file and you will see a sepreate `tkinter` window pop up.
- Use the on-screen sliders and have fun at creating your own RBG colour!
